_This is a fork of koekeishiya's yabai tiling window manager; its main differences are allowing moving windows without scripting addition (use the mouse action `move2`), and using multiple modifier keys for mouse actions. It also supports more than 2 mouse actions._

_This package is head-only; to install, do `brew install sourtin/formulae/yabai-sourtin` and then `brew services start yabai-sourtin`._

## About

<img align="right" width="40%" src="assets/screenshot.png" alt="Screenshot">

yabai is a window management utility that is designed to work as an extension to the built-in window manager of macOS.
yabai allows you to control your windows, spaces and displays freely using an intuitive command line interface and optionally set user-defined keyboard shortcuts using [&nearr;&nbsp;skhd][gh-skhd] and other third-party software.

The primary function of yabai is tiling window management; automatically modifying your window layout using a binary space partitioning algorithm to allow you to focus on the content of your windows without distractions.
Additional features of yabai include focus-follows-mouse, disabling animations for switching spaces, creating spaces past the limit of 16 spaces, and much more.

## Installation and Configuration

- The [&nearr;&nbsp;yabai&nbsp;wiki][yabai-wiki] has both brief and detailed installation instructions for multiple installation methods, and also explains how to uninstall yabai completely.
- Sample configuration files can be found in the [&nearr;&nbsp;examples][yabai-examples] directory. Refer to the [&nearr;&nbsp;documentation][yabai-docs] or the wiki for further information.
- Keyboard shortcuts can be defined with [&nearr;&nbsp;skhd][gh-skhd] or any other suitable software you may prefer.

## Requirements and Caveats

Please read the below requirements carefully.
Make sure you fulfil all of them before filing an issue.

|Requirement|Note|
|-:|:-|
|Operating&nbsp;System|macOS&nbsp;High&nbsp;Sierra&nbsp;10.13.6, Mojave&nbsp;10.14.4+ and Catalina 10.15.0+ is supported.|
|Accessibility&nbsp;API|yabai must be given permission to utilize the Accessibility API and will request access upon launch. The application must be restarted after access has been granted.|
|Mission&nbsp;Control|In the Mission Control preferences pane in System Preferences, the setting "Displays have separate Spaces" must be enabled.|

Please also take note of the following caveats.

|Caveat|Note|
|-:|:-|
|System&nbsp;Integrity&nbsp;Protection|System Integrity Protection needs to be (partially) disabled for yabai to inject a scripting addition into Dock.app for controlling windows with functions that require elevated privileges. This enables control of the window server, which is the sole owner of all window connections, and enables additional features of yabai. If you are running on macOS High Sierra 10.13.6, you can reenable SIP after the scripting addition has been installed.|
|Code&nbsp;Signing|When building from source (or installing from HEAD), it is recommended to codesign the binary so it retains its accessibility and automation privileges when updated or rebuilt.|
|Mission&nbsp;Control|In the Mission Control preferences pane in System Preferences, the setting "Automatically rearrange Spaces based on most recent use" should be disabled for commands that rely on the ordering of spaces to work reliably.|
