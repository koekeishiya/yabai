Some window properties are only accessible when yabai has a valid AX\-reference for that window.
.br
This AX\-reference can only be retrieved when the space that the window is visible on, is active.
.br
If windows are already opened on inactive spaces when yabai is launched, yabai can detect those
.br
windows and retrieve a limited amount of information about them. In addition, yabai window commands
.br
will NOT WORK for these windows. These windows can be identified by looking at the \f(CRhas\-ax\-reference\fP
.br
property. Once the space that the window belongs to becomes active, yabai will automatically create
.br
an AX\-reference. The queries will from that point forwards contain complete information, and the window
.br
can be used with yabai window commands.
.sp
The properties that contain incorrect information for windows with \f(CRhas\-ax\-reference: false\fP are as follows:
