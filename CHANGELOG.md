## [Unreleased]

## [2.2.0] - 2020-01-19
### Added
- Ability to do real picture-in-picture of any arbitrary window [#286](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai/issues/286)

### Changed
- Disable live-resizing of bsp-layout when using mouse-drag so that we are consistent with other mouse-interactions [#341](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai/issues/341)
- Improved spin-lock while waiting for native-fullscreen enter/exit animation to end [#339](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai/issues/339)
- New attribute uuid returned through display queries [#346](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai/issues/346)
- Ignore window moved events for windows in native-fullscreen mode. This is necessary because of weird macOS behaviour where a window in fullscreen-mode would trigger a window_moved event upon entering mission-control [#347](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai/issues/347)
- Allow borders to join native-fullscreen spaces because some applications create sub-windows that are visible in fullscreen spaces [#353](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai/issues/353)
- Ignore mouse-up event after clicking on a window maximize button [#354](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai/issues/354)
- Proper error reporting for rules and signals [#357](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai/issues/357)
- Properly preserve layout of spaces belonging to 4k and 5k displays after waking from sleep [#259](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai/issues/259)
- Add guard to make sure that we cannot incorrectly tile a window twice in case of weird macOS event behaviour [#348](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai/issues/348)
- Properly detect when mission-control is exited (with dock visible, hidden, and while a fullscreen space is active) [#319](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai/issues/319)

## [2.1.3] - 2019-11-29
### Changed
- Fix regression causing window_destroyed signal to not be triggered (after adding app and title filter) [#308](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai/issues/308)
- Fixed an invalid memory access when using mouse-drag to warp a window to another display when both displays contain only a single window [#309](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai/issues/309)
- Reset zoom of all nodes in the subtree of the node that got removed [#289](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai/issues/289)
- Adding/removing nodes to/from the tree should properly reset the zoom-state [#227](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai/issues/227)
- Ability to enable/disable debug output at runtime [#312](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai/issues/312)
- Fix improper calculation of overlapping parts of status_bar when truncating title, and resolve an invalid free if the title could not be truncated [#313](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai/issues/313)
- Automatically offset the position of the status_bar if the macOS Menubar is not set to autohide [#220](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai/issues/220)
- Remove the line drawn at the bottom of the status_bar in a *poorly dimmed* version of the background color.
